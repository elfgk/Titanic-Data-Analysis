# Titanic Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. The goal is to explore the data and build a machine learning model to predict passenger survival based on features such as age, class, gender, and ticket information.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - The Titanic dataset is explored to understand the features and the relationships between them. Basic data cleaning and preprocessing are done at this stage.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features to prepare it for machine learning.

3. **Model Building:**
   - A machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) is built to predict the survival of passengers.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are also performed to optimize the model's performance.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Various visualizations are created using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to better understand the dataset and the relationships between features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains the following columns:

- `PassengerId`: Unique ID for each passenger.
- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- `Name`: Name of the passenger.
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
- `Age`: Age of the passenger.
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
- `Parch`: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
- `Ticket`: Ticket number.
- `Fare`: Fare paid by the passenger.
- `Cabin`: Cabin number.
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).
- `Survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- `xgboost` (optional): For boosting models and improving prediction accuracy.
